<p align="justify">This is our first year working together as a full team, combining our diverse experiences across RoboCup Junior divisions. Julia and Arusha previously competed in the Primary Division of Rescue Line individually when they were younger, building a strong foundation in autonomous robotics. Maya and Julia also collaborated on a project in the OnStage division as part of Team JAM Session, which earned 2nd place internationally at RoboCup 2024 in Eindhoven. This year, we’ve brought Arusha—who was previously too young to join our Open team—into the group. At the 2025 American SuperRegionals, we placed 1st in the United States and 5th overall, and we’ve made significant technical improvements since then. In 2025 we represented USA in the international competition in Salvador. We are looking forward to improving this coming year! </p>

# About the Competition
synopsis of rules



# About our project

## Hardware
- electronics
- cad
- determine how we would want to solve and check all cases (ex obst) and figure out hardware solutions that would make it easier
  - add limit switches on back, and surroind wheels with chassis so bot doesnt get stuck
  - like one billion tof front and back on all sides, do we need 45 deg ones?


## Software
- linetracing/ special cases
- victim detection
- any cool solutions

#### idk if we want to share
